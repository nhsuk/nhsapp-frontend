Create prototypes for user research using the [NHS App prototype](https://design-system.nhsapp.service.nhs.uk/get-started/nhsapp-prototype/). There are lots of [benefits of protoyping in code](https://digital.nhs.uk/blog/design-matters/2025/why-we-are-reinvesting-in-the-nhs-prototype-kit).

However, Figma is also a helpful tool for quickly creating and collaborating on concepts. Using the NHS App Figma library, you can add ready-made NHS App design system components and patterns into your Figma file.

## How to check for updates to the Figma library

1. In your Figma file, select **Assets** in the left-hand menu.
2. Select the book icon to open your libraries.
3. Select **Updates**. This will show you any assets that have been updated in the NHS App Figma library, and how many instances of each asset there are in your file.
4. Select **Update** next to individual assets or select **Update all** to update everything in your file. You may first need to toggle on "Show updates for all pages" if you have multiple pages in your file.
