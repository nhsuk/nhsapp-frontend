Create prototypes for user research using the [NHS App prototype](https://design-system.nhsapp.service.nhs.uk/get-started/nhsapp-prototype/). There are lots of [benefits of protoyping in code](https://digital.nhs.uk/blog/design-matters/2025/why-we-are-reinvesting-in-the-nhs-prototype-kit). 

However, Figma is also a helpful tool for quickly creating and collaborating on concepts. Using the NHS App Figma library, you can add ready-made NHS App design system components and patterns into your Figma file.
