You can store your prototype securely on GitHub and run it on Heroku for user testing.

## Storing your code in GitHub

Store your prototype as a repository in the [GitHub NHS Digital](https://github.com/NHSDigital) organisation account. To get access, follow the guidance on [requesting access to the GitHub NHS Digital organisation (on SharePoint)](https://nhs.sharepoint.com/:u:/r/sites/X26_EngineeringCOE/SitePages/GitHub-User---how-to-request-access.aspx?csf=1&web=1&e=7WzUKB).

### Naming your prototype in GitHub

Name your prototype to avoid confusion with production services. Use the format `nhsapp-prototype-` followed by your service name, such as `nhsapp-prototype-prescriptions`.

## Using Heroku to host your prototype

If you plan to test your prototype with users, you might want to run it as a website instead of on your local device.

We use [Heroku](https://www.heroku.com/) to host and publish NHS App prototypes online. To get started, review the [Heroku cloud platform guidance (on SharePoint)](https://nhs.sharepoint.com/:u:/r/sites/X26_URPG/SitePages/tools/Heroku-cloud-platform.aspx?csf=1&web=1&e=geWbJC) and the [guidance on publishing your prototype online](https://prototype-kit.service-manual.nhs.uk/how-tos/publish-your-prototype-online).

Heroku can [automatically deploy code changes from your GitHub repository](https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/github-integration#:~:text=specified%20GitHub%20repo.-,Enabling%20GitHub%20Integration,to%20configure%20automatic%20GitHub%20deploys.).
