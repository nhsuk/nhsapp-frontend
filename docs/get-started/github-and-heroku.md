Storing your prototype kit code securely and using Heroku to run prototypes for testing with users.

## Setting up Git

You first need to follow the NHS prototype guidance on [setting up Git](https://prototype-kit.service-manual.nhs.uk/how-tos/git).

## Storing your code in GitHub

Prototypes should be stored as repositories in the [GitHub NHS Digital](https://github.com/NHSDigital) organisation account.

Guidance on how to [get access to GitHub NHS Digital organisation](https://nhs.sharepoint.com/:u:/r/sites/X26_EngineeringCOE/SitePages/GitHub-User---how-to-request-access.aspx?csf=1&web=1&e=7WzUKB) is on SharePoint.

### Naming your prototype in GitHub

You should name your prototype to prevent people getting confused with production services. Use `nhsapp-prototype-` followed by the name of your service, for example: `nhsapp-prototype-prescriptions`
