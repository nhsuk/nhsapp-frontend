You can use GitHub to store your prototype securely and Heroku to run it for user testing.

## Storing your code in GitHub

Prototypes should be stored as repositories in the [GitHub NHS Digital](https://github.com/NHSDigital) organisation account.

You can find guidance on how to [get access to the GitHub NHS Digital organisation](https://nhs.sharepoint.com/:u:/r/sites/X26_EngineeringCOE/SitePages/GitHub-User---how-to-request-access.aspx?csf=1&web=1&e=7WzUKB) on SharePoint.

### Naming your prototype in GitHub

You should name your prototype to prevent people getting confused with production services. Use `nhsapp-prototype-` followed by the name of your service, for example: `nhsapp-prototype-prescriptions`

## Using Heroku to host your prototype

Depending on what testing you plan to do with users, you might want to run your prototype as a website, rather than on your local device.

We use Heroku to host prototypes. To host an NHS App prototype on Heroku, you first need to store your code on GitHub, then [contact the NHS App design system team](/community/help-and-feedback/), who will setup an Heroku app and URL for you.
