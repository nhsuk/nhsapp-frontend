To make your service consistent with the NHS, you should start by checking what exists in the [NHS design system](https://service-manual.nhs.uk/design-system).

If something is not in the NHS design system, you should check what exists in the:

- NHS App design system
- [government department pattern libraries](https://github.com/ctdesign/gov-design-systems-list)
- [NHS community backlog](https://github.com/nhsuk/nhsuk-service-manual-community-backlog)
- [NHS App design system backlog](https://github.com/orgs/nhsuk/projects/8)

Reuse as much as possible and iterate based on user needs.

## Using the design system

The NHS App design system brings together [components and patterns](/components/) created by designers and developers on the NHS App.

To use these components and patterns you can either:

- copy the HTML code
- copy the Nunjucks code (if you are using [Nunjucks](https://mozilla.github.io/nunjucks/) or the [NHS prototype kit](https://nhsuk-prototype-kit.azurewebsites.net/docs))

## Contributing to the design system

You can contribute your research findings, designs or code to the NHS App design system by commenting on [existing issues](https://github.com/orgs/nhsuk/projects/8) or starting a [new issue](https://github.com/nhsuk/nhsapp-frontend/issues/new/choose) on GitHub.
