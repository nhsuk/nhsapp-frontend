The NHS App prototype is a copy of the NHS prototype kit with the [NHS App frontend](/get-started/nhsapp-frontend) and [components](/components) pre-installed, along with page templates.

You can use it to create interactive prototypes that resemble real NHS App pages.

The prototype is useful for anyone who wants to:

- test ideas
- get feedback from users or colleagues

To use the prototype you'll need some basic knowledge of HTML, for example what tags and attributes are and how to copy and paste code.

You can learn basic HTML and CSS at [mdn](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/HTML/Introduction_to_HTML/Getting_started), [codecademy](https://www.codecademy.com/) or other online tutorials.

## Setup

To get started with the prototype, you'll need to install some additional tools and software. Follow the [NHS prototype kit setup guide](https://prototype-kit.service-manual.nhs.uk/install) to ensure you have everything required to run the prototype.

## Download

Once you're set up, you can [download a copy of the NHS App prototype from GitHub](https://github.com/nhsuk/nhsapp-prototype).

## Guides

The [NHS prototype kit guides](https://prototype-kit.service-manual.nhs.uk/how-tos) will walk you through using the prototype kit, from creating a simple page to building complex user journeys.
