The [NHS App prototype](https://github.com/nhsuk/nhsapp-prototype) is based on the [NHS prototype kit](https://prototype-kit.service-manual.nhs.uk/). It comes pre-installed with the [NHS App frontend](/get-started/nhsapp-frontend), [components](/components), and page templates.

This allows anyone to create interactive prototypes that look like real NHS App pages.

For user testing, it's essential to code detailed prototypes using the NHS App prototype or NHS prototype kit. This is important, as noted in the [UCD centre of expertise guidance (on SharePoint)](https://nhs.sharepoint.com/:u:/r/sites/X26_URPG/SitePages/nhs-prototype-kit.aspx?csf=1&web=1&e=aZFAoj).

## Setup

To start with the prototype, you need to install some tools and software. Follow the [NHS prototype kit setup guide](https://prototype-kit.service-manual.nhs.uk/install) to get everything necessary to run the prototype.

## Download the NHS App prototype

Once you're set up, you can [download it as a zip](https://github.com/nhsuk/nhsapp-prototype/archive/refs/heads/main.zip).

There's guidance on how to download and store prototypes for [Mac](https://prototype-kit.service-manual.nhs.uk/install/mac/download) and [Windows](https://prototype-kit.service-manual.nhs.uk/install/windows/download).

  <p>You can also <a href="/get-started/install-nhsapp-frontend">add the NHS App frontend to the NHS prototype kit</a>, but it's worth noting that the NHS App page templates are not included.</p>

## Using the prototype

To use the prototype, you'll need some basic knowledge of HTML, such as understanding tags and attributes, and how to copy and paste code.

You can learn basic HTML and CSS at [mdn](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/HTML/Introduction_to_HTML/Getting_started), [codecademy](https://www.codecademy.com/), or other online tutorials.

Additionally, there are helpful [NHS prototype kit guides](https://prototype-kit.service-manual.nhs.uk/how-tos) that will guide you from creating a simple page to building complex user journeys.
