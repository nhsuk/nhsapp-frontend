The NHS App lets you create interactive prototype that look like real NHS App pages. It builds on the NHS prototype kit with added custom layouts and components tailored to the NHS App.

## 1. Get started as a first-time user

If you havenâ€™t used the NHS App prototype before, you can get started by:

- [setting up the NHS App prototype](/get-started/nhsapp-prototype-setup/)
- [learning how to use the NHS App prototype](/get-started/nhsapp-prototype-learn/)

## 2. Download a copy

The simplest way to get a copy is to [download it as a zip](https://github.com/nhsuk/nhsapp-prototype/archive/refs/heads/main.zip).

You can also clone or download a copy from [GitHub](https://github.com/nhsuk/nhsapp-prototype).

You can download a new copy for each project and [store your code on GitHub](/get-started/github-and-heroku).

## 3. Build your pages with templates and components

The NHS App prototype includes pre-installed code specific to the app, such as:

- [page templates and layouts](https://nhs-app-redesign-prototype-96ab88b99fdb.herokuapp.com/pages/)
- [components](https://nhs-app-redesign-prototype-96ab88b99fdb.herokuapp.com/components/)

These are available within your copy of the prototype and can be edited or extended to meet the needs of your project.

## 4. Help improve the NHS App prototype
