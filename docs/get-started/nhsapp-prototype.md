The [NHS App prototype](https://github.com/nhsuk/nhsapp-prototype) is a copy of the [NHS prototype kit](https://prototype-kit.service-manual.nhs.uk/), pre-installed with the [NHS App frontend](/get-started/nhsapp-frontend), [components](/components) and page templates. This allows anyone to create interactive prototypes that resemble real NHS App pages.

For user testing, it's essential to code detailed prototypes using the NHS App prototype or NHS prototype kit, as stated in the [UCD centre of expertise guidance on SharePoint](https://nhs.sharepoint.com/:u:/r/sites/X26_URPG/SitePages/nhs-prototype-kit.aspx?csf=1&web=1&e=aZFAoj).

If you're already using the NHS prototype kit and want to use the NHS App components, you can [add the NHS App frontend to the prototype kit](/get-started/install-nhsapp-frontend). Note that you won't have the page templates included in the NHS App prototype.

## Setup

To get started with the prototype, you'll need to install some additional tools and software. Follow the [NHS prototype kit setup guide](https://prototype-kit.service-manual.nhs.uk/install) to ensure you have everything required to run the prototype.

## Download the NHS App prototype

Once you're set up, you can [download it as a zip](https://github.com/nhsuk/nhsapp-prototype/archive/refs/heads/main.zip).

There's some guidance on how to download and keep prototypes for [Mac](https://prototype-kit.service-manual.nhs.uk/install/mac/download) and [Windows](https://prototype-kit.service-manual.nhs.uk/install/windows/download).

## Using the prototype

To use the prototype, you'll need some basic knowledge of HTML, such as understanding tags and attributes, and how to copy and paste code.

You can learn basic HTML and CSS at [mdn](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/HTML/Introduction_to_HTML/Getting_started), [codecademy](https://www.codecademy.com/), or other online tutorials.

Additionally, there are useful [NHS prototype kit guides](https://prototype-kit.service-manual.nhs.uk/how-tos) that will walk you through using the prototype kit, from creating a simple page to building complex user journeys.
