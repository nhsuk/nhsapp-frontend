## About

The NHS App prototype is a copy of the NHS prototype kit with added app-specific page templates and components.

## Download a copy

You can also clone or download a copy from [GitHub](https://github.com/nhsuk/nhsapp-prototype).

You can download a new copy for each project you work on and [store your code on GitHub](/get-started/github-and-heroku).

## Page templates and components

In your copy of the NHS App prototype you wil find:

- [page templates and layouts](https://nhs-app-redesign-prototype-96ab88b99fdb.herokuapp.com/pages/)

These can be edited or extended as needed to suit your project requirements.
