The NHS App prototype builds on the NHS prototype kit, adding custom layouts and components tailored to the NHS App. It enables teams to create interactive prototypes that look like real NHS App pagess.

## Download a copy

The simplest way to get a copy is to [download it as a zip](https://github.com/nhsuk/nhsapp-prototype/archive/refs/heads/main.zip).

You can also clone or download a copy from [GitHub](https://github.com/nhsuk/nhsapp-prototype).

You can download a new copy for each project and [store your code on GitHub](/get-started/github-and-heroku).

## Tools and software required

To use the prototype, you need to install some tools and software.

Follow the [NHS prototype kit setup guide](https://prototype-kit.service-manual.nhs.uk/install) to get everything necessary to run the prototype.

Once setup is complete, return here to download the NHS App prototype.

## Learn to use the prototype

Basic knowledge of HTML is required, such as understanding tags and attributes, and how to copy and paste code.

You can learn basic HTML and CSS at [mdn](https://developer.mozilla.org/), [codecademy](https://www.codecademy.com/), or other online tutorials.

There are also helpful [NHS prototype kit guides](https://prototype-kit.service-manual.nhs.uk/how-tos) that will guide you from creating a simple page to building complex user journeys.

We recommend following the [build a basic prototype tutorial](https://prototype-kit.service-manual.nhs.uk/how-tos/build-basic-prototype/index) to familiarise yourself with prototyping.

## Page templates and components

The NHS App prototype includes pre-installed code specific to the app, such as:

- [page templates and layouts](https://nhs-app-redesign-prototype-96ab88b99fdb.herokuapp.com/pages/)
- [components](https://nhs-app-redesign-prototype-96ab88b99fdb.herokuapp.com/components/)

These are available within your copy of the prototype and can be edited or extended to meet the needs of your project.
