title: Information architecture of the NHS App
---

Information architecture is about how content is structured, arranged and labelled. Good information architecture makes it easy for users to find what they need.

The Navigation and Onboarding team look after the information architecture of the NHS App.

## Our approach

We want to make it quick and easy for users to find things in the NHS App. We can do this by:

- structuring the app in a way that’s simple and intuitive
- grouping information in ways that meet with users’ mental models – rather than by data sources or other system-imposed categories
- using labelling that’s clear and easy to understand

We use a range of user research methods to discover where users expect to find things, including::

- card sorts to understand how users naturally group information
- tree tests to see how easily they can find things if we change the structure and labelling of the overarching sections
- moderated and unmoderated usability testing, to find out how detailed designs compare in terms of findability and ease of use

## Current work

The information architecture of the app is constantly evolving as we learn more from users and as new features are added.

We're currently exploring a new iteration of the information architecture.

We’re focused on:

- the role and position of the GP health record
- improving the homepage and better defining its role
- enhancing the account hub
- simplifying the overall structure for users, to reduce duplication and siloed links

## The current information architecture

The NHS App has a [homepage](/patterns/homepage/) and four [hub pages](/patterns/hub-page/). These pages connect users with services they can use and sub-hubs that lead deeper into the app.

Across all parts of the app, the options available to users depend on which services their GP surgery has turned on.

## Using the sitemap

You can view the [sitemap (on Figma)](https://www.figma.com/file/KFydJohITA4qMVpEqCghCo/%E2%9C%8F%EF%B8%8F-Frontier--%3E-NHS-App-Navigation-%26-IA?type=design&node-id=3%3A597&mode=design&t=9n9RqjUFYJ2LBbEP-1) to see the complete structure of the NHS App.
