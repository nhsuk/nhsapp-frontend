This guide explains how to set up your project so you can start using the styles and coded examples in the NHS App design system in production.

## Before you start

First you must have followed the [NHS design system production setup guide](https://service-manual.nhs.uk/design-system/production).

## Include the NHS App frontend in your project

To start using NHS App styles, components and patterns contained here, youâ€™ll need to include NHS App frontend in your project.

### Install using npm

We recommend [installing NHS App frontend using npm](/get-started/installing-with-npm/). Using this option, you will be able to:

- selectively include the CSS for individual components
- build your own styles or components based on the palette or typography and spacing mixins
- customise the build (for example, overriding colours or enabling global styles)
- use the component Nunjucks templates
