To use the NHS App prototype, you’ll need some basic knowledge of HTML – like understanding tags and attributes, and how to copy and paste code.

## Learning HTML and CSS

- [W3Schools online web tutorials](https://www.w3schools.com/html/default.asp)
- or other online tutorials

## NHS prototype kit guides

The [NHS prototype kit guides](https://prototype-kit.service-manual.nhs.uk/how-tos) provide step-by-step instructions – from creating a simple page to building complex user journeys.

### Build a basic prototype tutorial

We recommend following the [build a basic prototype tutorial](https://prototype-kit.service-manual.nhs.uk/how-tos/build-basic-prototype/index) to familiarise yourself with prototyping.

## NHS App prototype templates and components

The NHS App prototype includes pre-installed code specific to the app, such as:

- [page templates and layouts](https://nhs-app-redesign-prototype-96ab88b99fdb.herokuapp.com/pages/)
- [components](https://nhs-app-redesign-prototype-96ab88b99fdb.herokuapp.com/components/)

These are available within your copy of the prototype and can be edited or extended to meet the needs of your project.
