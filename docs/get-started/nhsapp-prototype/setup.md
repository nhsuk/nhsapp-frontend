To use the NHS App prototype, you'll need a few tools installed. If you already have them, you can skip ahead and download a copy.

## Install required tools

You need:

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download) version 20 or higher
- an HTML text editor, such as [Visual Studio Code (VS Code)](https://code.visualstudio.com/download)

If you're not sure whether the tools are installed – or how to install them – follow the [NHS prototype kit setup guide](https://prototype-kit.service-manual.nhs.uk/install/simple) to get everything you need.

## Download the NHS App prototype

The simplest way to get a copy is to [download it as a zip](https://github.com/nhsuk/nhsapp-prototype/archive/refs/heads/main.zip).

You can also clone or download a copy from [GitHub](https://github.com/nhsuk/nhsapp-prototype).
