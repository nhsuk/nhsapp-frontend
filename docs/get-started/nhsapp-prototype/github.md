Store your prototype as a repository in the GitHub NHS Digital organisation account.

1. Request access to the GitHub NHS Digital organisation. Follow the [GitHub users guidance on SharePoint](https://nhs.sharepoint.com/:u:/r/sites/X26_EngineeringCOE/SitePages/GitHub-User---how-to-request-access.aspx?csf=1&web=1&e=T1oQKj) (use your `nhs.net` email to access this link).
2. Once you have access, go to the [GitHub NHS Digital organisation](https://github.com/NHSDigital) and use your `nhs.net` email to log in.
3. Select **New** to create a repository.
4. Name your prototype to avoid confusion with production services. Use the format `nhsapp-prototype-[project-name]`, such as `nhsapp-prototype-prescriptions`.
5. Select **Internal** and **Create repository**.
6. Upload your prototype to GitHub. You can follow the NHS prototype kit guidance on how to [store code online with GitHub and GitHub Desktop](https://prototype-kit.service-manual.nhs.uk/how-tos/github/index).
