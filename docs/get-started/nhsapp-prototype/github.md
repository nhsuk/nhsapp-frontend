Store your prototype as a repository in the [GitHub NHS Digital](https://github.com/NHSDigital) organisation account. To get access, follow the guidance on [requesting access to the GitHub NHS Digital organisation (on SharePoint)](https://nhs.sharepoint.com/:u:/r/sites/X26_EngineeringCOE/SitePages/GitHub-User---how-to-request-access.aspx?csf=1&web=1&e=7WzUKB).

### Naming your prototype in GitHub

Name your prototype to avoid confusion with production services. Use the format `nhsapp-prototype-` followed by your service name, such as `nhsapp-prototype-prescriptions`.
