This guide explains how to create prototypes using the NHS App design system and NHS App prototype, so you can make interactive prototypes that will look like pages on the NHS App.

## Before you start

The NHS App prototype is a copy of the NHS prototype kit, with added NHS App code and templates.

You must follow the [NHS prototype kit setup guide](https://prototype-kit.service-manual.nhs.uk/install) first.

## Download

Download or clone a copy of the [NHS App prototype on GitHub](https://github.com/nhsuk/nhsapp-prototype).

## Guides

[NHS prototype kit guides](https://prototype-kit.service-manual.nhs.uk/how-tos) will show you how to use the prototype kit, from creating a simple page to building complex user journeys.

## Using components

You can use [NHS design system components](https://service-manual.nhs.uk/design-system) and [NHS App specific components](/components/).

There are 2 ways to use components. You can either use HTML or a Nunjucks macro.

You can copy the code from the HTML or Nunjucks tabs below any examples:

{% example "buttons/button-primary.njk" %}
