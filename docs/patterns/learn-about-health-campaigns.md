## When to use

Use this pattern on the home screen to promote prioritised public health campaigns that:

- are relevant to most NHS App users
- have an onward digital journey that meets our [usability and accessibility standards](https://digital.nhs.uk/services/nhs-app/how-to-integrate-with-the-nhs-app/standards-for-nhs-app-integration)

Campaigns that are not run by the NHS should ideally have a journey that has been [integrated with the NHS App](https://digital.nhs.uk/services/nhs-app/how-to-integrate-with-the-nhs-app#standards-for-nhs-app-integration).

## How to use

The campaign card consists of an image, a heading and body text. The whole card is one selectable link.

### Image

The photography we use on the campaign card is usually decorative rather than informative. This means alt-text is not usually needed. Check the [service manual guidance on alt-text](https://service-manual.nhs.uk/accessibility/content) to make sure.

### Heading

The heading should have a persuasive tone. The wording of existing headings or slogans for the campaign can be a helpful reference point.

There is space for one line of heading text. The maximum character count is 23 characters including spaces.

### Body text

The body text should have an informative tone. It should help users understand what they can do if they follow the link.

There is space for two lines of body text. The maximum character count is 75 characters including spaces.

## Research

In usability testing, participants noticed and engaged with the campaign card. They responded positively to the tone of the text, the use of photography, and the idea of campaigns being shown on the home screen.
