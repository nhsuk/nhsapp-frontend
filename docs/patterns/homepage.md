## The structure of the homepage

{% example "homepage/homepage-web.njk" %}

### Page heading

This page heading includes a greeting that changes depending on the time of day. Research suggested this helps the app feel more personal to users.

### Section headings

Section headings are used to divide the card links across the page. This helps users understand how the journeys are organised within the app. The ‘view all’ links give users an in-page way to navigate to hub pages. In usability testing these links were the most common way that users proceeded from the homepage into the ‘Services’ and ‘Your health’ hubs.

### Card links

Selecting one of these card links takes a user either directly into the start of a journey, or deeper into the app to a sub-hub.

### Campaign card

This card can be used to promote seasonal or topical campaigns such as COVID or flu vaccines, blood donation or being part of health research.

## Proposing changes to the homepage

We are careful to limit the number of links that are shown in the homepage. We need to ensure that users can quickly scan through the page and access the most popular features of the NHS App.

The Navigation and Onboarding Team maintains and updates the homepage. We regularly review and test the selection of links displayed. If you would like to suggest changes to the homepage, please contact the team.

## Research

In our research, users were able to complete a variety of tasks successfully from the starting point of the homepage. In one unmoderated usability test where people were tasked with booking an appointment for a relative, 90% completed the task successfully and all participants selected the correct onward link from the homepage.

In research we also found that users perceived the display of personal information, particularly their NHS number, to be valuable.
