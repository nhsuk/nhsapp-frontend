## The structure of a hub page

### Main heading

This is the name of the hub page.

### Description text (optional)

You can use a brief description to give users more context about a hub page. We donâ€™t include full stops at the end of this description, following a similar principle to the [NHS service manual guidance on cards](https://service-manual.nhs.uk/content/formatting-and-punctuation#full-stops).

### Section heading

Use [section headings](/components/section-heading) to break up card links into themes.

This can help users to scan the information on the page more easily and reduces the cognitive load. Research shows that people can be overwhelmed by long lists on NHS App pages.

Do not list more than 6 card links in a row without using a section heading.

### Card links

[Card links](/components/card-links) on the hub pages can lead either directly into a service or feature, or to a sub-hub where more options are available.

## How to use hub pages

Hub pages are used as the main navigational pages within the information architecture of the NHS App. They must always be accessible from either the top navigation bar or the bottom navigation bar of the NHS App so that users can select them at any time.

## How not to use hub pages

Do not include a back button on hub pages. Hub pages are the starting point for deeper pages in the app, which should always include a back button.
