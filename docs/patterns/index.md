description: Patterns are tested and agreed solutions to common needs.

Patterns often use one or more [components](/components/) and explain how to adapt them to the context.

Use these patterns in addition to those in the [NHS design system](https://service-manual.nhs.uk/design-system).

## Iterating a pattern

Use existing patterns as starting points, but you may need to iterate them to meet user needs for particular services.

Before iterating a pattern make sure there is a clear user need to do so.
