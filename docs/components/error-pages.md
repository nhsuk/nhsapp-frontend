description: Use an error page to tell users there is a problem. Explain what has happened and what they can do about it.
---

## When to use

Use an error page when:

- something has gone wrong
- users cannot continue to the next page

## When not to use

Do not use an error page when users make mistakes while completing forms. Instead, follow the NHS service manual guidance for in-page validation error messages, to help users understand what they need to do in context.

## How to use

The content of error pages must tell users:

- what has happened
- what they can do next

### Describe the problem

Use the main heading to describe the problem.

Write the heading using the active voice. Starting with “We” or “You” can help make clear where the issue comes from. For example:

- “We could not connect you to the NHS App”
- “You need to update the NHS App”

### Explain the next steps

You should primarily use the body of an error page to explain what users can do next.

Use a secondary button to provide the main action on the page. This should be the main step users can take to overcome the error.

Sometimes, you may need to use the start of the body text to give more detail about the problem. In this case, use the sub-heading “What you can do” to clearly separate the problem from the solution.

### Explain what to do if the problem continues

Sometimes users may need to contact the NHS App team if an error keeps happening. Use the sub-heading “If the problem continues” to provide this information.

#### Give alternative actions

You can use secondary card links to give users alternative actions they could take. This could be a link to a related service.

Use the sub-heading “Other things you can do” to give alternative actions.

Use the sub-heading “Find out more” to include supplementary information pages uses might find it helpful to read.

### Give medical signposting

If the error may be stopping a user from accessing particular medical help, it may be relevant to include signposting to a health service. This could be to their GP surgery if the error occurs while accessing a GP service, or to 111 online. 

Use [inset text](https://service-manual.nhs.uk/design-system/components/inset-text) at the bottom of the page to give 111 signposting. 

Medical signposting is not always needed. There is a risk of users thinking health services can help with technical problems. Check with the clinical team if you need guidance.
