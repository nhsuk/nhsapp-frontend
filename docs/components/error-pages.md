title: Error pages
description: Use an error page to tell users there is a problem. Explain what has happened and what they can do about it.

## When to use

Use an error page when:

- something has gone wrong
- users cannot continue to the next page

## When not to use

Do not use an error page when users make mistakes while completing forms. Instead, follow the NHS service manual guidance for [error messages](https://service-manual.nhs.uk/design-system/components/error-message) and [error summaries]([https://service-manual.nhs.uk/design-system/components/error-message](https://service-manual.nhs.uk/design-system/components/error-summary). These display on form pages to show users what they need to do in context.

## How to use

The content of error pages must tell users:

- describe the problem
- explain the next steps

### Describe the problem

Use the main heading to describe the problem. 

Be as specific as possible about what has gone wrong. For example:

- Face ID did not work
- No internet connection

It may be helpful to use "We" or "You" to help users understand where the problem lies:

- You need to update the NHS App
- We could not log you in

In our research we found participants were much less concerned with what had gone wrong than with finding out what they need to do next. Try to sum up the problem in the heading, then move onto the solution or next steps in the body text.

### Explain the next steps

Users are likely to scan the page and read body content quickly. You might need to:

- give an action in the form of a secondary button
- suggest alternative options using secondary card links

Our research suggests users rarely read content placed beneath a button. If you include a button, place other content above it. 


### Explain what to do if the problem continues

Sometimes users may need to contact the NHS App team if an error keeps happening. Use the sub-heading “If the problem continues” to provide this information.


### Give medical signposting

If the error may be stopping a user from accessing particular medical help, it may be relevant to include signposting to a health service. This could be to their GP surgery if the error occurs while accessing a GP service, or to 111 online.
