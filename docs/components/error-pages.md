description: Use an error page to tell users there is a problem. Explain what has happened and what they can do about it.

## When to use

Use an error page when:

- something has gone wrong
- users cannot continue to the next page

## When not to use

Do not use an error page when users make mistakes while completing forms. Instead, follow the NHS service manual guidance for in-page validation error messages, to help users understand what they need to do in context.

## How to use

The content of error pages must tell users:

- what has happened
- what they can do next
