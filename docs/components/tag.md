## When to use

Use tags to help users:

- understand the status of an activity or a process
- keep track of progress
- understand when they need to take an action

For example, tags can help users to:

- track prescription requests
- understand when they need to take an action regarding a hospital referral

## When not to use

Too many tags, and lots of variation in tag colours, may clutter a page and overwhelm users. Tags can also affect the visual hierarchy of a page. This means tags should be used sparingly.

## How to use

Tags can be placed within a card or outside of one. Inside a card, tags should always be left-aligned. Outside a card, tags can be aligned to the left or the right.

Tag text should:

- be in sentence case
- describe status in as few words as possible

## How not to use

Do not use tags:

- as a header or grouping-class for elements or information
- as a selectable element

Tag text should not:

- be in bold
- start with a verb â€“ users may think they can select the tag

## Accessibility

Tag colours meet [WCAG 2.2 Success Criterion 1.4.3 Contrast (Minimum)](https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG22/#contrast-minimum) AAA.

## Research

In our research, we found that red tags could cause some participants to feel concerned. Red was associated with something having gone wrong.
