## When to use

The top navigation is visible at the top almost every screen within the main app journey. The exception is when external pages open in a web browser overlay.

The top navigation remains fixed in position as users scroll.

## When not to use

On the web browser version of the NHS App, we use an [NHS.UK header](https://service-manual.nhs.uk/design-system/components/header) with text links, instead of the top navigation with icons.

## How to use

The top navigation includes a link to the NHS App help and support pages hosted on NHS.UK. This is a contextual link that takes users to a page relevant to their location in the app. For example, if a user is on a prescription screen, the help link will open a help page about prescriptions.

The top also includes an ’Account and settings’ link. This opens the respective hub page.

## Accessibility

The top navigation icons do not have text labels. They have aria labels which are announced by screen readers.

## Research

In our research, people recognised the meaning of the icons without the need for text labels.
