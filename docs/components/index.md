You should use these components in addition to those in the [NHS design system](https://service-manual.nhs.uk/design-system). We will share the design and research of these components with the NHS design system so they can be used more widely.

## Iterating a component

You can use existing components as starting points, but you may need to iterate them to meet user needs for particular services.

Before iterating a component make sure there is a clear user need to do so. [Share any changes you make or research findings](/community/share-findings/) in the [NHS App design system backlog](https://github.com/orgs/nhsuk/projects/8).
