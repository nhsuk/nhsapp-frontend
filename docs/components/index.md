description: Design components solve common problems so teams can focus on the things unique to their service and its users.

Use these components in addition to those in the [NHS design system](https://service-manual.nhs.uk/design-system).

## Iterating a component

Use existing components as starting points, but you may need to iterate them to meet user needs for particular services.

Before iterating a component make sure there is a clear user need to do so.

[Share any changes you make or research findings](/community/share-findings/) in the NHS App design system backlog.
