description: These are components designed specifically for the needs of NHS App users and are not yet in the NHS Design System.

Check the [NHS Design System](https://service-manual.nhs.uk/design-system) to see if the component or pattern you need is already being used across government.

## Can't find what you need?

If you can't find what you need in the NHS Design System or the NHS App design components, you can:

- see if it is being worked on by other teams across the NHS and add your findings in the [community backlog](https://github.com/nhsuk/nhsuk-service-manual-community-backlog/projects/1)
- see if it is being worked on by the NHS App and add your findings in the [NHS App component backlog](https://github.com/orgs/nhsuk/projects/8)
- [propose a new component](https://github.com/nhsuk/nhsapp-frontend/issues/new?assignees=&labels=&projects=&template=new_component_or_pattern.md&title=)

All patterns must meet the [contribution criteria](https://service-manual.nhs.uk/community-and-contribution/contribution-criteria).

## Using code snippets in prototypes

Each pattern includes coded examples. You will need to install [NHS App Frontend]() to use components with specific NHS App code not yet supported by the NHS Prototype Kit.

Find out how to:

- [set up the Prototype Kit](https://nhsuk-prototype-kit.azurewebsites.net/docs)
- [update the Prototype Kit](https://nhsuk-prototype-kit.azurewebsites.net/docs/how-tos/updating-the-kit)
