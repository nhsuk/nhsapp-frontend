title: NHS App design components
description: These are components designed specifically for the needs of NHS App users and are not yet in the NHS design system.
---

Check the [NHS design system](https://service-manual.nhs.uk/design-system) to see if the component you need is already being used across the NHS.

## Can't find what you need?

If you can't find what you need in the NHS design system or the NHS App design components, you can check the:

- [NHS design system backlog](https://github.com/nhsuk/nhsuk-service-manual-community-backlog/projects/1)
- [NHS App component backlog](https://github.com/orgs/nhsuk/projects/8)

## Using code snippets in prototypes

Each component includes coded examples. You will need to install [NHS App frontend](/components/install-nhsapp-frontend-in-your-prototype) to use components with specific NHS App code not yet supported by the NHS Prototype Kit.

Find out how to [set up the prototype kit](https://nhsuk-prototype-kit.azurewebsites.net/docs).
