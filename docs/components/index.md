title: NHS App design components
description: These are components designed specifically for the needs of NHS App users and are not yet in the NHS design system.
---

Check the [NHS design system](https://service-manual.nhs.uk/design-system) to see if the component you need is already being used across the NHS.

If you can't find what you need in the NHS design system or the NHS App design components, you can:

- [check the NHS community backlog](https://github.com/nhsuk/nhsuk-service-manual-community-backlog/projects/1) to see if it is being worked on by other teams across the NHS and add your findings
- [check the NHS App component backlog](https://github.com/orgs/nhsuk/projects/8) to see if it is being worked on by the NHS App and add your findings
- [add a new component to the NHS App component backlog](https://github.com/nhsuk/nhsapp-frontend/issues/new?assignees=&labels=&projects=&template=new_component_or_pattern.md&title=)

## Using code snippets in prototypes

Each component includes coded examples. You will need to install [NHS App frontend](/components/install-nhsapp-frontend-in-your-prototype) to use components with specific NHS App code not yet supported by the NHS Prototype Kit.

Find out how to [set up the prototype kit](https://nhsuk-prototype-kit.azurewebsites.net/docs).
