## Finding the component you need

Check the [NHS design system](https://service-manual.nhs.uk/design-system) to see if the component you need is already being used across the NHS.

If you can't find what you need in the NHS design system or the NHS App design system, you can:

- [check the NHS community backlog](https://github.com/nhsuk/nhsuk-service-manual-community-backlog/projects/1)
- [check NHS App design system backlog](https://github.com/orgs/nhsuk/projects/8)

## Using code snippets in prototypes

Each component includes coded examples. You will need to install [NHS App frontend](/get-started/prototyping) to use components with specific NHS App code not yet supported by the NHS Prototype Kit.

Find out how to [set up the prototype kit](https://nhsuk-prototype-kit.azurewebsites.net/docs).
