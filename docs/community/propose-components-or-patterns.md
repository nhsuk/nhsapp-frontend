Check what components and patterns are in progress using the [NHS App components and patterns backlog](https://github.com/orgs/nhsuk/projects/8).

## If your idea is on the backlog

You can contribute to the GitHub thread and:

- add examples or evidence you have to support the proposal
- ask to work on the proposal

## If your idea is not on the backlog

Propose a new component or pattern using the [GitHub issue template](https://github.com/nhsuk/nhsapp-frontend/issues/new?assignees=&labels=type%3A+feature+request%2C+awaiting+triage&projects=&template=new_feature.yaml&title=%5BFeature+request%5D%3A+).

Describe your idea and give evidence of user needs. The design system team will respond and discuss the idea with you.
