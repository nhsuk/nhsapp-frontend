The NHS App design system helps people across the NHS App to learn from each other, share knowledge and reuse as much as possible.

Anyone can contribute. You just need a [GitHub account](https://github.com/signup) so you can:

- [share your findings](/community/share-findings/)
- [suggest a change](/community/suggest-a-change/)

If you need any help using GitHub, you can [contact the design system team](/community/help-and-feedback/).
