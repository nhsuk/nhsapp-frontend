The NHS App design system helps us learn from each other, share knowledge and reuse as much as possible.

Anyone can contribute. You just need a GitHub account.

## How to use GitHub

GitHub is an online platform. We use it for community collaboration and hosting code.

If you do not have one already, [create a GitHub account for free](https://github.com/signup).

On one level, you can simply use GitHub like an online forum. You can take part in conversations and leave comments.

You can also use GitHub for more advanced tasks. This includes storing prototypes and proposing changes to the design system. [Following the GitHub tutorial](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/start-your-journey/hello-world) can help you learn more about the GitHub workflows used in such tasks.
