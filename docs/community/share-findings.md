You can do this by taking part in discussions on GitHub.

Useful findings to share might be things like:

- summaries of user research you’ve done
- prototypes or ideas that you’ve tested
- analytics from your service
- responses to any calls for information we give in the ‘Research’ section of our pages

## 1. Find the thing you want to feedback on

If the thing is already published in the NHS App design system, go to the relevant page. You'll find a link to the GitHub issue at the bottom of the page.

Or you can go directly to GitHub and look at the [NHS App design system backlog](https://github.com/orgs/nhsuk/projects/8).

You can use search to find things, for example "button".

Click on the issue to see the discussion and scroll to the bottom if you want to comment.

## 2. Leave a comment

You need to [sign up to GitHub](https://github.com/signup) if you want to comment. Anyone can sign up for free.

Use the textbox at the bottom of the page to give your feedback or share insights.

There is no set format for posting comments. Even short summaries can be helpful.

You can edit your comment after you post it, so do not worry if you get something wrong or want to change it later.

Community members might respond to your findings on GitHub. Feel free to take part in the conversation.

Remember that all the information on GitHub is open to the public. Do not share any personally identifiable information about your participants or sensitive information about your service.

## 3. What happens next

After you have submitted your comment, the NHS App design system team will:

- get a notification from GitHub
- review the issue
- let you know if the team will take any action

The NHS App design system team does not usually act immediately on feedback. We sometimes need to see evidence across several teams before we can be sure that something is a problem.

Even if your findings do not lead to a change to the design system, it’s really useful to share anyway. People across the NHS App read the discussions on GitHub to see how others have approached things and what they’ve learned.
