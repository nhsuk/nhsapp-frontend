# NHS App Frontend

NHS App Frontend is a CSS library built on top of [nhsuk-frontend](https://github.com/nhsuk/nhsuk-frontend) providing styles for the NHS App.

> [!NOTE]
> We are currently in the process of testing NHS App Frontend. The NHS App Frontend is not currently used on the NHS App.

## Contact the team

NHS App Frontend is mainatined by staff at NHS England. If you have a question, you can use [GitHub issues](https://github.com/nhsuk/nhsapp-frontend/issues) or one of these Slack channels:

- [#general](https://nhs-service-manual.slack.com/archives/CDJ29AQCD) on NHS service manual Slack
- [#forum-app-design-system](https://nhsdigitalcorporate.enterprise.slack.com/archives/C06GY1LRP19) on NHS England Slack

## Building on the NHS digital service manual

The NHS App uses the [NHS design system](https://service-manual.nhs.uk/design-system), however it also uses custom design styles, components and patterns that need documenting with guidance.

## Documenting NHS App design styles, components and patterns

We use a GitHub project board to track the design styles, components and patterns being used on the NHS app, including progress, examples, feedback, questions and user insights. All this information links back to the [NHS digital service manual community backlog](https://github.com/nhsuk/nhsuk-service-manual-community-backlog/projects/1) so anyone working on an NHS project can look and learn from it.
