# NHS App Frontend

NHS App Frontend is a CSS library built on top of [nhsuk-frontend](https://github.com/nhsuk/nhsuk-frontend) providing styles for the NHS App.

See live examples of NHS App Frontend components, and guidance on when to use them in your service, in the [NHS App Frontend components documentation](https://design-system.nhsapp.service.nhs.uk/components/).

## Contact the team

NHS App Frontend is mainatined by staff at NHS England. If you have a question, you can use [GitHub issues](https://github.com/nhsuk/nhsapp-frontend/issues) or one of these Slack channels:

- [#general](https://nhs-service-manual.slack.com/archives/CDJ29AQCD) on NHS service manual Slack
- [#nhsapp-design-system](https://nhsdigitalcorporate.enterprise.slack.com/archives/C06GY1LRP19) on NHS England Slack

## Building on the NHS digital service manual

The NHS App uses the [NHS design system](https://service-manual.nhs.uk/design-system), however it also uses NHS App-specific design components and patterns that need documenting with guidance.

## Documenting NHS App design components and patterns

We use a [GitHub project board](https://github.com/orgs/nhsuk/projects/8/views/1) to track design components and patterns used across the NHS app, along with any feedback, questions or user insights. All this information links back to the [NHS digital service manual community backlog](https://github.com/nhsuk/nhsuk-service-manual-community-backlog/projects/1) so anyone working on an NHS project can look and learn from it.
